# Streamlit PowerPoint Generator

This web app scrapes the data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance library and creates PowerPoint slides about selected company. The code can be used as a starting point for more complex slide automation projects. Thanks to Streamlit, there is no need to write HTML/CSS code and time from idea to proof of concept is significantly shortened.
